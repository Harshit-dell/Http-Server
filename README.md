## 📘 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I explored and implemented key backend development concepts, including:

- 🌐 Understanding the HTTP protocol and how HTTP servers handle requests and responses
- 🧠 Building an HTTP server in Java to process client requests
- 🛠️ Handling JSON data using the Jackson library (`ObjectMapper`, `JsonNode`)
- 🧵 Using `var` for type inference to write cleaner, more concise Java code
- ✅ Performing basic CRUD operations and validating input data
- 🔁 Parsing JSON request bodies and returning JSON responses
- 📡 Sending appropriate HTTP status codes and structured responses

  ## Problem I Faced:
  
    At first, I was pretty confused about how the backend and frontend actually communicate. It was like they were speaking
 different languages! I kept wondering how data moves between them and how I could connect the two so they work together smoothly.
